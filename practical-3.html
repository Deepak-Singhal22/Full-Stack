    <h3>About Course</h3>

    <p>
        Front-end web development is everything involved in programming the user interface of a web application.
        Typically it refers to the Hypertext Markup Language (<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>),
        Cascading Style
        Sheets (<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr>) and JavaScript portion of web site production as opposed
        to the database or
        server-side
        programming. It encompasses everything from building a simple page of <abbr
            title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> text to
        creating complex, responsive HTML5 websites designed to be accessed via various different browsers, devices and
        screen sizes.
